Rubber Duck Debris Tracker
=====================

Contrary to popular beliefs, space around Earth is far from empty.

Our project’s goal is to counter the “out of sight, out of mind” careless approach of the general public towards the issue of space debris. In order to make it memorable, entertaining and funny, we decided to show space debris from an Earthling’s perspective but with a twist: we have marked known space debris with oversized rubber duckies.
